Scenario: Telecommunication Data Management using Medallion Architecture in Databricks (Bronze, Silver, and Gold Layers)
In the telecommunications industry, companies handle vast amounts of data generated by user activities, such as call logs, data usage, and network performance. Using Delta Lake's Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) allows for efficient handling and querying of these large datasets.

Scenario Overview:
We will create a Delta Lake pipeline that processes raw call logs (telecom events) using the Medallion Architecture:

Bronze Layer: Raw data, uncleaned and untransformed.
Silver Layer: Cleaned and filtered data with some transformations applied.
Gold Layer: Aggregated and business-ready data used for reporting and analysis.
We will use an imaginary telecom dataset consisting of user activity logs, including columns like:

user_id: Unique identifier for the user.
call_duration: Duration of each call in minutes.
signal_strength: Strength of the network signal (1 to 5).
data_usage: Amount of data used in megabytes.
timestamp: Time of the event.


Activity Plan
Activity 1: Set Up Databricks Environment

Objective: Set up your Databricks environment to process the dataset.
Action Points:
Open your Databricks workspace.
Set up a new notebook in Databricks.
Attach the notebook to a cluster.
Download the dataset from the above link and upload it to DBFS (Databricks File System).
Activity 2: Load Data into Bronze Layer

Objective: Load the raw telecom events data into the Bronze Layer.

Activity 3: Explore and Query Bronze Layer

Objective: Query the raw data in the Bronze Layer.


Activity 4: Clean and Transform Data for Silver Layer

Objective: Clean the raw data and prepare it for the Silver Layer.

Activity 5: Explore and Query Silver Layer

Objective: Query and analyze the cleaned data in the Silver Layer.

Activity 6: Aggregate Data for Gold Layer

Objective: Aggregate the data and prepare it for the Gold Layer.

Activity 7: Explore and Query Gold Layer

Objective: Query the aggregated data in the Gold Layer.

Activity 8: Time Travel in Delta Lake

Objective: Utilize Delta Lakeâ€™s time travel feature to query older versions of data.

Activity 9: Optimize the Delta Tables

Objective: Optimize the performance of Delta tables using OPTIMIZE and ZORDER commands.

Summary of Activities
Set up Databricks and load the dataset.
Create and query the Bronze Layer with raw data.
Clean and transform the data for the Silver Layer.
Aggregate data for the Gold Layer and query the business-ready data.
Utilize time travel to query earlier versions of the data.
Optimize the Delta tables for performance improvements.
