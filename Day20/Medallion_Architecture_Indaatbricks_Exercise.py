Scenario: Telecommunication Data Management using Medallion Architecture in Databricks (Bronze, Silver, and Gold Layers)
In the telecommunications industry, companies handle vast amounts of data generated by user activities, such as call logs, data usage, and network performance. Using Delta Lake's Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) allows for efficient handling and querying of these large datasets.

Scenario Overview:
We will create a Delta Lake pipeline that processes raw call logs (telecom events) using the Medallion Architecture:

Bronze Layer: Raw data, uncleaned and untransformed.
Silver Layer: Cleaned and filtered data with some transformations applied.
Gold Layer: Aggregated and business-ready data used for reporting and analysis.
We will use an imaginary telecom dataset consisting of user activity logs, including columns like:

user_id: Unique identifier for the user.
call_duration: Duration of each call in minutes.
signal_strength: Strength of the network signal (1 to 5).
data_usage: Amount of data used in megabytes.
timestamp: Time of the event.


Activity Plan
Activity 1: Set Up Databricks Environment

Objective: Set up your Databricks environment to process the dataset.
Action Points:
Open your Databricks workspace.
Set up a new notebook in Databricks.
Attach the notebook to a cluster.
Download the dataset from the above link and upload it to DBFS (Databricks File System).
Activity 2: Load Data into Bronze Layer

Objective: Load the raw telecom events data into the Bronze Layer.

Action Points:
Load the dataset telecom_events.csv into a DataFrame.
python
Copy code
# Load raw data into a DataFrame
bronze_df = spark.read.option("header", "true").option("inferSchema", "true").csv("/dbfs/mnt/data/telecom_events.csv")
Save the data as a Delta table for the Bronze Layer.
python
Copy code
# Save data as Delta table for Bronze layer
bronze_df.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").save("/delta/bronze/telecom_events")
Create a table in the Bronze Layer.
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS bronze_telecom_events
USING DELTA
LOCATION '/delta/bronze/telecom_events';
Activity 3: Explore and Query Bronze Layer

Objective: Query the raw data in the Bronze Layer.
Action Points:
Write a simple SQL query to retrieve data from the Bronze Layer.
sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM bronze_telecom_events;
Analyze the structure and raw data characteristics (e.g., nulls, duplicates).
Activity 4: Clean and Transform Data for Silver Layer

Objective: Clean the raw data and prepare it for the Silver Layer.
Action Points:
Clean the data by removing nulls and duplicates, and filter records where signal_strength > 1.
python
Copy code
# Clean and filter data for Silver Layer
silver_df = bronze_df.dropna().dropDuplicates().filter(bronze_df.signal_strength > 1)
Save the cleaned data into the Silver Layer.
python
Copy code
# Save the cleaned data to the Silver Layer
silver_df.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").save("/delta/silver/telecom_events")
Create a table in the Silver Layer.
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS silver_telecom_events
USING DELTA
LOCATION '/delta/silver/telecom_events';
Activity 5: Explore and Query Silver Layer

Objective: Query and analyze the cleaned data in the Silver Layer.
Action Points:
Write a query to retrieve data from the Silver Layer.
sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM silver_telecom_events;
Verify that the cleaning operation removed nulls, duplicates, and filtered low signal strength records.
Activity 6: Aggregate Data for Gold Layer

Objective: Aggregate the data and prepare it for the Gold Layer.
Action Points:
Group the data by user_id and calculate the total call duration and data usage.
python
Copy code
# Aggregate data for Gold Layer
gold_df = silver_df.groupBy("user_id").agg({"call_duration": "sum", "data_usage": "sum"})
# Rename columns
gold_df = gold_df.withColumnRenamed("sum(call_duration)", "total_call_duration").withColumnRenamed("sum(data_usage)", "total_data_usage")
Save the aggregated data into the Gold Layer.
python
Copy code
# Save the aggregated data to the Gold Layer
gold_df.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").save("/delta/gold/telecom_user_summary")
Create a table in the Gold Layer.
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS gold_telecom_user_summary
USING DELTA
LOCATION '/delta/gold/telecom_user_summary';
Activity 7: Explore and Query Gold Layer

Objective: Query the aggregated data in the Gold Layer.
Action Points:
Write a query to retrieve data from the Gold Layer.
sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM gold_telecom_user_summary;
Analyze the aggregated results, focusing on total call duration and data usage per user.
Activity 8: Time Travel in Delta Lake

Objective: Utilize Delta Lakeâ€™s time travel feature to query older versions of data.
Action Points:
Query the data using the version number (e.g., the first version of the Silver Layer).
python
Copy code
# Time travel to version 0 of the Silver Layer
silver_version_0 = spark.read.format("delta").option("versionAsOf", 0).load("/delta/silver/telecom_events")
silver_version_0.show()
Query the data using a timestamp.
sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM delta.`/delta/silver/telecom_events`
TIMESTAMP AS OF '2024-09-13 10:00:00';
Activity 9: Optimize the Delta Tables

Objective: Optimize the performance of Delta tables using OPTIMIZE and ZORDER commands.
Action Points:
Use the OPTIMIZE command to compact small files and improve query performance.
sql
Copy code
OPTIMIZE delta.`/delta/gold/telecom_user_summary`;
Optionally, use ZORDER to optimize queries on specific columns (e.g., user_id).
sql
Copy code
OPTIMIZE delta.`/delta/gold/telecom_user_summary` ZORDER BY (user_id);

Summary of Activities
Set up Databricks and load the dataset.
Create and query the Bronze Layer with raw data.
Clean and transform the data for the Silver Layer.
Aggregate data for the Gold Layer and query the business-ready data.
Utilize time travel to query earlier versions of the data.
Optimize the Delta tables for performance improvements.
