Step-by-Step Process:
1. Extract Gold Table Data from Databricks

You need to extract data from the gold layer (gold table) in Databricks. The following Python code in Databricks will allow you to query the Delta table (gold table).

python
Copy code
# Databricks Python code to query the Gold Layer (Delta Table)
gold_table = spark.sql("SELECT * FROM gold_layer_table")  # Replace with your actual table name
gold_table.show()

# Convert Spark DataFrame to Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation
gold_df = gold_table.toPandas()
Make sure your gold layer table contains aggregated or business-ready data that you want to visualize in Power BI.

2. Prepare Data for API Transmission

Once you have the data from the gold layer, prepare it as a JSON payload that can be sent to Power BI via the REST API.

Hereâ€™s how you can convert the DataFrame into a format ready for the API:

python
Copy code
import json

# Convert the pandas dataframe to a list of dictionaries (JSON format)
gold_data = gold_df.to_dict(orient='records')

# Convert list of dictionaries to JSON string
json_payload = json.dumps(gold_data)
Now, the data is in the correct format (JSON) to be sent to the Power BI Streaming Dataset API.

3. Push Data to Power BI via REST API

You can now use Python's requests library to push the JSON payload to the Power BI Streaming Dataset API.

Python Script to Push Databricks Data to Power BI Streaming Dataset:
python
Copy code
import requests
import json

# Power BI Streaming Dataset API URL
# Replace this URL with your actual API URL from Power BI
api_url = 'https://api.powerbi.com/beta/your_workspace_id/datasets/your_dataset_id/rows?key=your_api_key'

# Function to send data to Power BI
def send_data_to_power_bi(json_payload):
    headers = {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
    
    # Send a POST request to Power BI API
    response = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers, data=json_payload)

    # Check if the data was sent successfully
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("Data sent successfully to Power BI!")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to send data to Power BI. Status Code: {response.status_code}")
        print(f"Response: {response.text}")

# Send the gold table data to Power BI
send_data_to_power_bi(json_payload)
Explanation of the Script:
Databricks Data Extraction:
The first part of the code extracts data from the gold table in Databricks and converts it into a Pandas DataFrame.
Data Preparation:
The second part of the script converts the DataFrame into a JSON format that is suitable for the Power BI API. This is done by using the to_dict() method and then converting the result into a JSON string using json.dumps().
Sending Data to Power BI:
The final part sends the JSON payload to the Power BI Streaming Dataset using the Power BI REST API. It makes a POST request to the API URL, passing the data as JSON.
4. Scheduling and Automation in Databricks

To continuously send data to Power BI, you can automate this process by scheduling a Databricks notebook or Databricks job that runs periodically to fetch updated data from the gold layer and send it to Power BI.

You can schedule the Databricks notebook to run every 30 minutes, 1 hour, or any other time interval depending on your needs.
Each time the notebook runs, it will fetch the latest data from the gold table, format it, and send it to Power BI.
5. Power BI Setup for Streaming Dataset
Make sure that you have set up a Power BI Streaming Dataset by following these steps:

Go to Power BI Service (powerbi.com).
Create a Streaming Dataset:
Click on Create > Streaming Dataset.
Choose API as the dataset source.
Define the dataset fields (e.g., timestamp, metrics like signal strength, usage, etc.).
Enable Historical Data: Ensure you enable Historical Data Analysis to retain the streamed data for future analysis.
6. Visualizing the Data in Power BI
Once the data is flowing from Databricks to Power BI, you can create visualizations based on the streaming dataset:

Real-Time Dashboards: Create visuals such as line charts, gauge charts, bar charts, and tables that update automatically as the data is streamed.
Pin Visuals: Pin the visuals to a Power BI Dashboard, and they will automatically refresh as new data is streamed from Databricks.
Summary
In this setup:

Data is extracted from the gold layer in Databricks (Delta Table).
The data is formatted as JSON and sent to Power BI using the Streaming Dataset API.
You can visualize the data in Power BI in real-time, and the dashboard updates as new data is pushed from Databricks.
