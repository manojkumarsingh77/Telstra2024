Use Case: Real-Time Network Performance Monitoring in a Telecom Company
The telecom company wants to monitor its network performance in real time. You will ingest data such as call durations, data usage, and network latency from Kafka using Spark Streaming. 
Once the data is ingested, you will filter and aggregate the results to gain insights such as:

1. Average network latency
2. Total data usage
3. Call duration patterns by region
4. Finally, the results will be visualized using Matplotlib.

Prerequisites:
1. Kafka and Zookeeper running.
2. Spark with PySpark installed.
3. Kafka Python library for producing and consuming data.
4. Matplotlib for visualizations.
5. Jupyter Notebook or any IDE supporting Python.
