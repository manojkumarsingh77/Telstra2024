Business Requirement Problem Statement: Telecom Customer Call Data Processing and Visualization


""The telecommunications company is facing challenges in analyzing customer call data, which is critical for understanding customer behavior, improving service quality, and optimizing network performance.
The current system lacks an automated, scalable solution for processing and analyzing large volumes of call data collected from various sources. 
The company requires a robust data pipeline to handle the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, ensuring that the data is clean, enriched, and ready for analysis. 
The final processed data should be easily accessible for visualization to derive actionable insights.""

Tasks to Perform:

	1.	Data Ingestion:
	•	Set up Azure Blob Storage to store raw customer call data in CSV format using python script.

	2.	Data Transformation:
	•	Design a data transformation process to filter out incomplete or dropped calls (calls with a duration of less than 10 seconds).
	•	Aggregate the data by region and network type to calculate key metrics such as total call count, total call duration, and average call cost.
	•	Enrich the data by categorizing calls into Short, Medium, and Long based on their duration.
	•	Ensure data quality by cleaning the dataset, removing null or missing values in critical columns.

	3.	Data Loading:
	•	Load the transformed data into ADLS Gen2 in Parquet format, organizing it by year, month, and day based on the call date.

	4.	Pipeline Orchestration:
	•	Build an Azure Data Factory pipeline to automate the entire ETL process, including data ingestion, transformation, and loading.
	•	Implement scheduling and monitoring to ensure the pipeline runs efficiently and handles potential failures.

	5.	Data Visualization:
	•	Write a Python script in Google Colab to connect to ADLS Gen2 and retrieve the processed data.
	•	Visualize key metrics such as the number of calls by region and network type, and the average call cost by call category using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

	6.	Reporting and Insights:
	•	Generate visual reports that highlight call patterns, customer service quality, and network performance.
	•	Provide actionable insights to the company based on the analyzed data to improve decision-making and customer satisfaction.
