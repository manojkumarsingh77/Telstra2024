Scenario: Predicting Customer Churn in a Telecom Company

Background:
A telecom company wants to predict which customers are likely to leave their service (churn). By predicting churn, the company can take action to retain customers before they decide to leave.

Dataset:

We’ll use a simplified version of a telecom churn dataset. Each record in the dataset represents a customer, and it contains information like customer tenure, monthly charges, contract type, and whether they’ve churned (left the service) or not.
